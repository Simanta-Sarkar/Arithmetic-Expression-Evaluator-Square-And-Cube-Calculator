# Arithmetic-Expression-Evaluator-Square-And-Cube-Calculator
Digital arithmetic forms the cornerstone of modern computing systems, playing a critical role in various domains such as embedded systems, digital signal processing (DSP), machine learning accelerators, and cryptographic engines. Among the fundamental arithmetic operations, exponentiation—especially squaring and cubing—is frequently used. While conceptually straightforward, implementing these operations in hardware can present challenges in terms of speed, area, and power optimization, particularly when targeting platforms with limited computational resources like FPGAs. This project, titled ”Arithmetic Expression Evaluator: Square and Cube Calculator”, presents the design, simulation, and FPGA-based implementation of a hardware module capable of evaluating arithmetic expressions of the form (A±B)2 and (A±B)3, where A and B are 8-bit binary inputs. The objective is to develop a compact and efficient design that supports both addition and subtraction between inputs and subsequently computes the square or cube of the result using elementary digital logic techniques.
The system is implemented using Verilog 2001, a widely utilized hardware description language that supports synthesizable and cycle-accurate modeling of digital circuits. To maintain simplicity and minimize resource usage, the design avoids reliance on complex multiplier IP cores. Instead, it employs the shift-and-add multiplication method, which replicates traditional long multiplication through conditional additions and bitwise shifts.
This methodology not only provides educational value but also aligns with the needs of resource-constrained environments where optimization is essential.
A structured hardware architecture was developed and thoroughly tested using a Verilog testbench to ensure functional accuracy. Following verification, the design was synthesized and deployed on the Basys 3 FPGA development board, which features a Xilinx Artix-7 FPGA. The board’s built-in components, including switches, buttons, LEDs, and seven-segment displays, were utilized for real-time input control and output visualization.
The execution of this project facilitated a deeper understanding of arithmetic unit design, FPGA workflows, and RTL development practices. It also provided hands-on experience with simulation, synthesis, timing constraints, clock division, and hardware debugging—core competencies in digital and embedded system design. In conclusion, this project bridges theoretical knowledge and practical hardware implementation. It highlights the importance of efficient arithmetic operations in digital systems and demonstrates how foundational techniques can be creatively applied to construct functionally rich, yet resource-efficient, hardware solutions.
